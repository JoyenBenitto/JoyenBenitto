ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Joyen Benitto

Iâ€™m a SoC Design Engineer at InCore Semiconductors, working on a core-agnostic SoC generatorâ€”both the methodology and the tooling that enables it. My focus is on hardware design automation, building scalable methodologies that streamline SoC development.

My interests lie at the intersection of RTL design, CAD tools, and architecture exploration. I work primarily with Bluespec, SystemVerilog, Python, Haskell, C++ and C, but I also enjoy using Rust and Scala/Chisel when the problem demands it.

I believe that hardware should be as composable as software, and Iâ€™m always exploring ways to make that a reality. If you're working on similar ideasâ€”or just curiousâ€”feel free to reach out, contribute, or report issues in any of my repositories.
