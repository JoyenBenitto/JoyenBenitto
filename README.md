Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm  [Joyen Benitto](https://joyenbenitto.com). I am a SoC Design Engineer [@InCore Semiconductors](https://incoresemi.com/) where I am developing a core agnostic SoC generator (methodology and the tool itself). I love writing RTL, Automation scripts, code generators, and computer architecture exploration tools.

I majorly work with bluespec, SV, C and python. however I also love using Go and Rust based on the project requirements. 
Feel free to build upon my existing work and report bug in any of my repos :)
