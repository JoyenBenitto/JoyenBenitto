# Hi, I’m Joyen 👋  

I’m a **systems and hardware engineer** working at the intersection of **SoC architecture, design automation, and computer systems**.

My work focuses on turning *high-level intent* into *working silicon* - from hardware generators and schedulers to compiler–architecture co-design.
